# borgbackup.github.io

This used to be the main website, which is now managed directly on http://readthedocs.org/projects/borgbackup and available at https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ (RTD).

The borgweb manual is still here: https://borgweb.readthedocs.io/

There are also redirections to the RTD site here to keep old URLs working for a while, although that doesn't work with sub-pages.

To manage the documentation and releases, see the development guide at: https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development.html#building-the-docs-with-sphinx
