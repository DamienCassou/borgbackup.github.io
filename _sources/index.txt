Welcome to Borg
================
|project_name| is a deduplicating backup program written in Python.
The main goal of |project_name| is to provide an efficient and secure way
to backup data. The data deduplication technique used makes |project_name|
suitable for daily backups since only the changes are stored.


Easy to use
-----------
Initialize a new backup :ref:`repository <repository_def>` and create your
first backup :ref:`archive <archive_def>` in two lines::

    $ borg init /mnt/backup
    $ borg create /mnt/backup::Monday ~/Documents
    $ borg create --stats /mnt/backup::Tuesday ~/Documents
    Archive name: Tuesday
    Archive fingerprint: 387a5e3f9b0e792e91ce87134b0f4bfe17677d9248cb5337f3fbf3a8e157942a
    Start time: Tue Mar 25 12:00:10 2014

    Duration: 0.08 seconds
    Number of files: 358
